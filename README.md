# Capture Stdout

Capture Stdout is a small, efficient ES6 class that captures (they will not end up on stdout) all stdout calls and stores the calls as an array of strings.   Very useful for confirming expected output behavior during tests.  It is usable out of the box in any Node 8.x environment without transpilers or other dependencies.

## Usage

```
  it('should error and log an error message if the persistence call throws an error', async () => {
    const captureStdout = new CaptureStdout();
    const msg = 'some error text here';

    // stub out the persistence call
    const findAll = sandbox.stub(orm.books, 'findAll');
    // stubbed persistence call is a promise, fail as one.
    findAll.rejects(Error(msg));

    captureStdout.startCapture();

    controller.getAll(req, res, next);
    await res;
    await next;

    captureStdout.stopCapture();
    const arrJson = captureStdout.getCapturedText().map(JSON.parse);
    captureStdout.clearCaptureText();

    expect(arrJson).has.lengthOf(1);
    expect(arrJson[0]).has.property('msg').contains(msg);
    expect(arrJson[0]).has.property('level').which.equals(50);
  });
```

### Constructor
new CaptureStdout()
### Methods
#### clearCaptureText()
Clears all of the captured text
#### getCapturedText() â†’ {Array} of String
#### startCapture()
Starts capturing the writes to process.stdout
#### stopCapture()
Stops capturing the writes to process.stdout.

## Motivation

I needed a simple, effective way to include logging of error messages in my tests.   I also didn't want to pollute the running test output.

## Installation

npm install capture-stdout
